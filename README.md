1. Project Title:
 Diabetes Prediction Pipeline using PySpark


2.Description:
This project demonstrates how to preprocess, analyze, and build a machine learning pipeline for diabetes prediction using **PySpar**. The pipeline includes data exploration, imputation of missing values, feature engineering, and model training using **Logistic Regression**. The model is then evaluated using metrics like **ROC AUC**.


3.Usage:

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Diabetes_Prediction_Pipeline.ipynb` and follow the steps to:
    - Load the dataset
    - Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
    - Train a **Logistic Regression** model
    - Evaluate model performance.
      
3.Features:
- Imputation of missing values using **mean imputation**
- Feature engineering including interaction terms and binning
- Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes outcomes
- Model evaluation using **ROC AUC**
- Cleaned dataset and trained model can be saved for future use
